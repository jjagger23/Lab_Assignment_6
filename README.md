# Lab Assignment 6
This code reads input from a file named "input.txt" containing multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a line with an integer indicating the number of elements in an array, followed by the elements of the array.

For each test case, the code calculates the average of the elements in the array and then searches for this average value in the array using the binary search algorithm. If the average value is found in the array, it prints the index where it was found; otherwise, it prints that the value does not exist in the array.

Finally, the code deallocates memory and repeats the process for each test case until the end of the input file is reached.
